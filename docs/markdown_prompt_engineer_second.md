## Advanced Features

### 1. Dynamic Table of Contents Generator

Add this subsection to your prompt:

```
Generate a dynamic table of contents:
- Auto-number sections (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1, etc.)
- Create anchor links for each heading
- Include section descriptions (one line each)
- Estimate reading time per section
- Mark optional vs required sections

Example format:
## Table of Contents
1. [Introduction](#1-introduction) (2 min) - Overview of the topic ‚≠ê Required
2. [Getting Started](#2-getting-started) (5 min) - Initial setup ‚≠ê Required
   2.1. [Prerequisites](#21-prerequisites)
   2.2. [Installation](#22-installation)
3. [Advanced Topics](#3-advanced-topics) (10 min) - Optional deep dives
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure Pattern

For complex topics, use progressive disclosure:

```
Structure the document with progressive complexity:

Level 1 (Must Know):
- Basic concepts and common use cases
- Quick start guide
- Essential commands/APIs

Level 2 (Should Know):
- Common patterns and best practices
- Intermediate examples
- Configuration options

Level 3 (Could Know):
- Advanced techniques
- Performance optimization
- Edge cases and troubleshooting

Use collapsible sections or clear visual hierarchy to separate levels.
```

### 3. Multi-Format Output

Request multiple output formats:

```
Provide three versions:

1. Full Version (markdown_full.md)
   - Complete documentation with all sections

2. Quick Reference (markdown_quick.md)
   - Condensed version with key points
   - Command reference
   - Common patterns only

3. Presentation Version (markdown_slides.md)
   - Formatted for reveal.js or similar
   - Slide breaks (---)
   - Speaker notes in comments
```

### 4. Validation and Linting

Add validation instructions:

```
After generation, perform validation:

Markdown Lint Checks:
‚ñ° No trailing whitespace
‚ñ° Consistent list markers (* or -)
‚ñ° Proper blank lines around elements
‚ñ° No duplicate heading text
‚ñ° Link references are defined
‚ñ° Code fences are closed
‚ñ° HTML is valid (if used)

Content Quality Checks:
‚ñ° No Lorem Ipsum or placeholder text
‚ñ° All examples are complete
‚ñ° Commands are tested/testable
‚ñ° No broken links
‚ñ° Consistent terminology
‚ñ° Proper capitalization
‚ñ° No orphan headings

If issues found, provide:
1. List of issues with line numbers
2. Corrected version
3. Explanation of changes
```

## Integration with Version Control

### Git-Friendly Markdown

```
Optimize the markdown for git workflows:

- Line length: Max 100 characters (for better diffs)
- One sentence per line (semantic line breaks)
- Avoid trailing spaces
- Use reference-style links for better readability in diffs:
  [link text][ref-id]
  
  [ref-id]: https://example.com

- Include a changelog section formatted for git log:
  ## Changelog
  
  ### [1.2.0] - 2025-10-16
  #### Added
  - New section on error handling
  #### Changed
  - Updated API examples to v2
  #### Fixed
  - Corrected typo in installation steps
```
